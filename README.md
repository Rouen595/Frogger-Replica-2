# Frogger-Replica-2
Frog Souls game for class



Microphone is working now... I checked the video file and there is sound so that's good. All files from my computer did upload so I'm hoping the project will work when downloaded
for grading.


EDIT from Saturday morning: rereading the assignment on blackboard it occurs to me that having music playing that can be toggled from the pause menu and saved in userprefs may be required. Regardless, I have written a short song and attached it to the game.

Also, ignore the built .exe in the game files... it was a build from an earlier version, before I added music I believe, and despite creating newer builds github has not updated the file. I recommend building and running it from inside Unity.
